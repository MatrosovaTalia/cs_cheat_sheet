# Trees

## Binary tree
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

**Height of a tree** - The length of the path from n to its deepest descendant. The height of the tree itself is the height of the root node, and the height of leaf nodes is always 0.

**Depth of a node** - The length of the path from a node, n, to the root node. The depth of the root node is 0.

### Complete BT
In a complete binary tree, every level except possibly the last, is completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

### Full Binary Tree
A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children
Each node has 0 or 2 descendants.   

### Tree traverlsals
DFS
1. Pre-order: Root -> Left -> Right
2. In order: Left -> Root -> Right
3. Post-order: Left -> Right -> Root
