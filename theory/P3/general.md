1â€™s complement of a binary number is another binary number obtained by toggling all bits in it, i.e., transforming the 0 bit to 1 and the 1 bit to 0.
```python

1's complement of 7 (0111) is 8 (1000)
1's complement of 12 (1100) is 3 (0011)
```
### Two's Complement
```python
2's complement of 7 (0111) is 9 (1001)
2's complement of 12 (1100) is 4 (0100)
```
